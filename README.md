## Maintenance Help Wanted!

Although this is an archive of the old repository, we would appreciate any help
in bringing those extensions up to date and usable with the current [Boost.GIL].

If any pull requests arrive, we will consider moving updated extensions to
[Boost.GIL] or creating dedicated repository in this space.
